## 📂 Directory Structure

The repository follows a structured directory for easier navigation:

```
leet-code-python-solutions/
│
├── easy/
│   ├── problem_1.py
│   ├── problem_2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── medium/
│   ├── problem_3.py
│   ├── problem_4.py
│   └── ...
│
└── hard/
    ├── problem_5.py
    ├── problem_6.py
    └── ...
```

In this structure:

- **easy/** contains solutions to easy LeetCode problems.
- **medium/** contains solutions to medium-level problems.
- **hard/** contains solutions to hard problems.

Each problem file includes a Python script that offers an efficient solution along with comments for clarity.

## 💡 Features

- **Clean Code**: Each solution is well-structured for easy understanding.
- **Explanations**: Comprehensive comments explain the logic behind the algorithms.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Each solution includes an analysis of its time and space complexity.
- **Regular Updates**: The repository is actively updated for new problems and solutions.

## 📖 How to Use the Solutions

After you have installed the software, you can start solving problems by following these instructions:

1. Navigate to the folder for the problem you want to solve (easy, medium, hard).
2. Open the corresponding Python file in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
3. Review the solution and comments. If you want to modify the code, feel free to do so.

To run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```sh
python path_to_your_file/problem_x.py
```

Replace `path_to_your_file` and `problem_x.py` with your actual file path and name.
